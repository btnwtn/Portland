# Downtown

## NW Side

This area is pretty seedy, specifically the 5th & Couch and Union Station MAX

don't go to them. NW side of Waterfront Park is toy, go to the SW side of
downtown for the waterfront.

Pearl District doesn't really have much stuff to do. Tanner Springs Park is ok
tho if you just want to check the area out.
